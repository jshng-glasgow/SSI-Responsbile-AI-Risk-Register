# Contributing to the SSI Generative AI Risk Register

Thank you for contributing to this register. This document explains how to propose new risks, suggest updates to existing risks, and how contributions are reviewed.

## Who can contribute?

Anyone is welcome to contribute. You do not need to be a member of the SSI or have a GitHub account to suggest a risk — see the Microsoft Form option below.

## Ways to contribute

### Propose a new risk (GitHub)
1. Go to the Issues tab
2. Click **New Issue**
3. Select **Propose a new risk**
4. Fill in the form and submit

Your proposal will automatically be added to a pull request for review. A maintainer will review and merge the pull request, at which point it will appear in the register.

### Propose an update to an existing risk (GitHub)
1. Go to the Issues tab
2. Click **New Issue**
3. Select **Update and existing risk**
4. Fill in the form, including the issue number of the risk you want to update

### Suggest a risk (no GitHub account needed)
If you don't have a GitHub account, you can suggest a risk via [this Microsoft Form](#). A maintainer will add it to the register on your behalf.

### Discuss a risk
If you want to discuss a proposed or existing risk before making a formal proposal, open a blank issue or comment on an existing one.

## Review process

All contributions are reviewed by the [Responsible AI Study Group](#) before being added to the register. Reviewers may ask for clarification or suggest amendments via issue comments.
